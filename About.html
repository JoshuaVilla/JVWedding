    <H1>Your Story</H1> <br>
     <p>How We Met:</p> <br>
     <dd>Judy: A successful bumble match story! Thought he was cute and I loved his sense of fashion, 
      especially his jean jacket! Sold me so swiped right and messaged him "Who's your favorite anime 
      character and why?" Few minutes later, he sent me a hugeee paragraph with analysis lol. From then on,
       we'd text in paragraphs.
      <br> <br>
      Josh: Was definitely a successful bumble match story! I was there on the toilet, where we all make 
      our most serious decisions. There I was, swiping on bumble, ready to give up on love as most, if not 
      all the people I’ve dated on these apps were not looking for a serious relationship like I was. Then 
      I match with Judy, we talked in paragraphs because it seems like we both really were in it to get to 
      know each other. I don’t watch the bachelor, but she does… but if I did and I knew references to it… 
      I might say that she gets the first impression rose here.</dd> <br>

  <p>First Date:</p> <br>
    <dd>Judy: We went on our very first date on March 28, 2021! I suggested KBBQ at my favorite spot, 
    356 Korean BBQ in San Diego because I love their beef tongue heh. I was gonna cancel because 
    i was stressed out with my eyeliner not looking good HAH but of course, I didn't because I really 
    hoped he didn't notice (He did but didnt say anything ).  When I was in the parking lot, I texted 
    him where to park and joked to "find me". He somehow parked next to me (without knowing/reading my text)
    and as SOON AS HE WALKED OUT OF HIS CAR, I saw what he was wearing and SCREAMED in my car at how good 
    looking he was!!!!! hahah I got out to meet him at the entrance and was so nervous walking up to him,
    but we hugged, put our name down and walked around the mall, getting to know each other more.
  <br>
    Once we sat down and ordered good meats + sofu, I felt super comfortable with him as if I knew him for 
    a very long time! I found myself laughing a lot and really enjoying my time. When the BEEF TONGUE came, 
    I had him try it - this heathen was going to eat it without any SAUCE. (I have this on video hahah) which
    he liked. After KBBQ, we (mostly I) were tipsy and went to HMART to get korean corndogs and then boba! 
    OH. And on the way to HMART, he almost "killed" us by driving almost into the wrong lane of the freeway 
    ENTRANCE (also on video) haha. Theeeeennnn when we went to go say goodbye.... we almost kissed. ALMOST.
      because I heard my good friend, Gladys' voice "No kissing on the first date". Heard the voice, freaked
      at how close we were getting and pushed him away from me heh....then we awkwardly said goodbye. When 
      I got home, I told him I really had a great time and would love to meet again. That lead to more dates
        throughout the week before he asked me to be his girlfriend on 04/03/21 .
    <br> <br>
    Josh: We went out on our first date to 356 K BBQ, never been to this spot, but I love K BBQ. We had some 
    video calls and got along well on all our interactions, so I thought it was gonna go all smoothly 
    committing to KBBQ on the first date. So, there it was… first date with Judy texted jokingly about 
    parking next to each other. My first time at this mall and all, I kinda just parked where it “felt good”.
    Only to find that she was just by me later on hahaha! We walked to the line, saw her with a top tier top 
    on showing her personality ;], signed in, then shared a really nice walk afterwards. Ngl, walking the 
    mall, holding hands, and talking about future dates and plans already made me feel like I was some 
    teenager about to fall in love for the first time :”). I think this was also the first time I had 
    extended a date since dating in America. We had Kbbq, korean corndogs, AND THEN BOBA. Bro, not sure if
      we were brought together by the cosmos or that we just had two enormous black holes for stomachs that 
      day set to collide.
    <br>
    Before my date, I had to check in on my friends at the time since I really didn’t know the culture 
    for dating in the U.S. with first date kisses. They told me to just ignore it and if the vibe is there 
    then go for it. I’m not usually one to do it, but with how much fun it was, how well we got along,
    accompanied with a pause in our good bye… I took a shot at the kiss and was instead launched 6 ft away
    instantly from Judy hearing a huff, her hands on my chest and next thing I know, I was obeying Covid 
    protocol.</dd> <br>

  <p>When You Know:</p> <br> 
  <dd>Judy: It was simple - we went to hmart to grab some dinner there because I was feeling sick 
  and afterwards, I asked him if it was okay if we went grocery shopping because I wanted to 
  get some stuff for my dad, and he agreed. Walking around the store, I felt "home" and I 
  knew I wanted to do even the simplest and mundane things with him forever. 
<br> <br>
  Josh: Mine was an accumumulation of things... She and I had such productive conversations as 
  to who we wanted to be to each other: growing together in age and for each other, sharing many
  of the same values, pretty much all the serious stuff were in-line between us. But if it were
  just one moment? One day, I was just being my normal hilarious self and she was just bawling, 
  laughing. And the immediate thought I had at the time was: "I want to make her happy like this
  the rest of our lives."</dd>
